#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Metabolomic investigations on Nesterenkonia flava from different origins
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	revealed significant intraspecies differences between marine and terrestrial
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	actinomycetes
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Marine is one of the most important resources of microorganisms, including
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi. As marine and terrestrial environments
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	differ a lot in many aspects it is not surprising that the species and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	characteristics of microorganisms living there are very different.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Interestingly, many marine microorganisms can find their congeners of the same
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	species from terrestrial resources. The aim of this work is to evaluate the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	intraspecies differences between marine and terrestrial actinomycetes on
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	metabolic level and to uncover the mechanism responsible for the differences. To
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	address this, we carried out comparative metabolomics study on Nesterenkonia
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	flava strains isolated from marine and terrestrial environments. The results
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	showed that marine strains were clearly distinguished from their terrestrial
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	congeners on the principal components analysis (PCA) scores plot of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	intracellular metabolites. The markers responsible for the discrimination of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	marine and terrestrial strains were figured out using loading plot from partial
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA). Pathway analysis based on
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	PLS-DA, univariate analysis, and correlation analysis of metabolites showed that
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	the major differential metabolites between the terrestrial N. flava and the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	marine ones were involved in osmotic regulation, redox balancing, and energy
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	metabolism. Together, these insights provide clues as to how the previous living
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	environment of microbes affect their current metabolic performances under
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	laboratory cultivation conditions.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	The broth cultures (50 mL) were harvested via centrifugation at 7000 g for 10
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	min under 4 °C. The pellet was quenched using 10 mL of 60% cold methanol (−80
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	°C) containing 0.85% (wt./vol.) of NaCl for 30 min. The quenched cell pellets
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	were re-suspended in 10 mL of cold PBS and were washed for 3 times.
CO:SAMPLE_TYPE                   	Cultured cells
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	For each cell pellet sample, 5 mL of the mixture of methanol/water (1:0.9, v/v)
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	was added and ultrasonicated for 25 min to break cells bathing in ice. The
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	mixture was added with 5 mL of cold chloroform, vortexed and subjected to 10 min
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	of ultrasonic extraction under the bath of ice. The mixture was then centrifuged
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	at 9500 g for 8 min. The upper layer phase containing methanol and water was
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	taken out and evaporated in the fume cupboard to remove methanol. The remaining
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	water solution was freezed under −80 °C, and then freeze-dried to afford dry
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	samples, which were stored under −80 °C before analysis.
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	The intracellular extract was re-suspended in 550 µL of phosphate buffer
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	containing 1.5 M KH2PO4, 0.1% sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate-2,2,3,3-d4
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	(TSP), and 10% D2O. Subsequently, all the samples were vortexed and centrifuged
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	at 12000 g for 15 min at 4°C to remove any insoluble components. The collected
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	supernatants (500 μL) were transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes for analysis.
