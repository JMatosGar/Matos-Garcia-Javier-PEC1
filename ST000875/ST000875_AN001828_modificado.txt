#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Metabolomic investigations on Nesterenkonia flava from different origins revealed significant intraspecies differences between marine and terrestrial actinomycetes
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Marine is one of the most important resources of microorganisms, including bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi. As marine and terrestrial environments differ a lot in many aspects it is not surprising that the species and characteristics of microorganisms living there are very different. Interestingly, many marine microorganisms can find their congeners of the same species from terrestrial resources. The aim of this work is to evaluate the intraspecies differences between marine and terrestrial actinomycetes on metabolic level and to uncover the mechanism responsible for the differences. To address this, we carried out comparative metabolomics study on Nesterenkonia flava strains isolated from marine and terrestrial environments. The results showed that marine strains were clearly distinguished from their terrestrial congeners on the principal components analysis (PCA) scores plot of intracellular metabolites. The markers responsible for the discrimination of marine and terrestrial strains were figured out using loading plot from partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA). Pathway analysis based on PLS-DA, univariate analysis, and correlation analysis of metabolites showed that the major differential metabolites between the terrestrial N. flava and the marine ones were involved in osmotic regulation, redox balancing, and energy metabolism. Together, these insights provide clues as to how the previous living environment of microbes affect their current metabolic performances under laboratory cultivation conditions.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	The broth cultures (50 mL) were harvested via centrifugation at 7000 g for 10 min under 4 °C. The pellet was quenched using 10 mL of 60% cold methanol (−80 °C) containing 0.85% (wt./vol.) of NaCl for 30 min. The quenched cell pellets were re-suspended in 10 mL of cold PBS and were washed for 3 times.
CO:SAMPLE_TYPE                   	Cultured cells
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	For each cell pellet sample, 5 mL of the mixture of methanol/water (1:0.9, v/v) was added and ultrasonicated for 25 min to break cells bathing in ice. The mixture was added with 5 mL of cold chloroform, vortexed and subjected to 10 min of ultrasonic extraction under the bath of ice. The mixture was then centrifuged at 9500 g for 8 min. The upper layer phase containing methanol and water was taken out and evaporated in the fume cupboard to remove methanol. The remaining water solution was freezed under −80 °C, and then freeze-dried to afford dry samples, which were stored under −80 °C before analysis.
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	The intracellular extract was re-suspended in 550 µL of phosphate buffer containing 1.5 M KH2PO4, 0.1% sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 (TSP), and 10% D2O. Subsequently, all the samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min at 4°C to remove any insoluble components. The collected supernatants (500 μL) were transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes for analysis.
